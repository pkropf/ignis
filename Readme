Ignis
-----

Ignis is an Arduino based control system for accumulator based flame
effects, also know as poofers. The system uses an arduino to control
solenoids that are connected to accumulator tanks holding propane
vapor. When released by the solenoid, the propane is ignited and
results in a large ball of fire. The system is designed to support up
to 48 poofers.

General Background
==================

There is a master console that provides for manually triggering the
poofers. The master console has:

 1. Emergency shutoff switch that removes power to all the solenoids,
    igniters and the Arduino controller.

 2. A toggle switch and momentary contact switch for each poofer. The
    toggle switch provides power to the hot surface igniter. The
    momentary contact switch is used to manually trigger the poofer
    solenoid.

The Arduino controller provides a mechanism to trigger each of the
poofer solenoids programatically. And external computer send
sequencing comands to the Arduino to let it know what sequence should
be triggered.
